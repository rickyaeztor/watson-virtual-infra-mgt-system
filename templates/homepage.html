    <h3> How the Application works? </h3>
    <p> This application only demonstrates and simulates one of the set of features of the Real-World Application.</p>
    <p> Once you select a VCenter Name from the drop down menu, the application retrieves all object (Cluster, ESX, Datastore) data collections.
        The data collections are then pass on to WATSON TRADEOFF ANALYTICS for analysis to come up with the preffered option on where a Virtual Machine
        can be created based from the json "defined" problem statement.
    </p>

    <p> <b>Note:</b> <br> <i> Due to time constraints during the codefest and since a true VSphere Infrastracture is not available for this demo, the actual objects are just being retrived from Cloudant database.
        In real-world application - the objects are retrieved from each Vcenter via batch job which is also being saved to database for faster transation and query
        (since logging in and looping through each Vcenter has considerable amount of lag time)</i>i
